### 1. Specialized AI Agent Marketplaces

These are new platforms specifically designed for buying and selling AI agent capabilities. Listing here is great for product-led growth (selling the agent itself).

* **[Agent.ai](https://agent.ai):** A professional network and marketplace specifically for AI agents. You can list your agents here for discovery.
* **[Kore.ai Marketplace](https://kore.ai):** Focuses on enterprise-grade agents. If your startup builds heavy-duty, secure agents for big business (e.g., banking, HR), this is a strong channel.
* **[AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) (AI & ML section):** If your agent is built on AWS or Bedrock, listing it here puts you directly in front of enterprise CTOs who have budget and need compliant solutions.
* **[MuleRun](https://mulerun.com):** A newer marketplace specifically for autonomous AI agents. Good for early adopters and selling "workflows" rather than just hours.

### 2. High-Quality Contract & Freelance Platforms

For "service-based" work (i.e., a client hires you to build a custom agent for them), avoid generic sites like Fiverr. Focus on these tech-centric platforms:

* **[Twine](https://www.twine.net):** They have a dedicated "AI Developers" section. Clients here often understand the tech better and budgets are generally higher than Upwork.
* **[Toptal](https://www.toptal.com):** Hard to get into (they accept top 3%), but if you get verified, the clients are Fortune 500 companies paying premium rates for specialized contract work.
* **[Lemon.io](https://lemon.io):** similar to Toptal but more startup-focused. Great for finding other founders who need your agent expertise to build their MVP.
* **[Upwork](https://www.upwork.com) (Targeted):** *Only* effective if you filter strictly. Search for "AI Automation," "LangChain," "AutoGPT," or "Custom Agent Development." Do not compete on price; compete on your specific niche (e.g., "Medical AI Agent Expert").

### 3. Where to Find "Hidden" Demand (Communities)

Most high-value agent work is not posted on job boards; it is discussed in communities. You need to be visible here.

* **Discord Servers:** Join the Discords of the tools you use (e.g., **LangChain**, **Flowise**, **OpenAI**, **n8n**).
* *Strategy:* Look for the "Hiring" or "Showcase" channels. Post a video demo of your agent. Founders lurking there will DM you.


* **LinkedIn:** Search for posts containing "looking for AI agency" or "hiring AI developer."
* *Strategy:* Don't just pitch. Post 30-second videos showing your specialized agent *solving a specific problem* (e.g., "Watch this agent parse a 50-page legal contract in 10 seconds").


* **Y Combinator "Work at a Startup":** If you want contract work with high-growth startups, check [Work at a Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com). Search for "AI Engineer" or "contract."

### 4. B2B Outreach (The "Sniper" Approach)

If your agent is specialized (e.g., "Real Estate Lead Qualifier"), don't wait for them to post a job.

* **Identify the Pain Point:** Find 50 Real Estate agencies.
* **Build a Demo:** Run *their* website or data through your agent.
* **Cold Email/DM:** "I ran your last 5 listings through my agent, and it automatically generated these Instagram captions and client emails. Would you like to use this?"
* **RFP Platforms:** For government or large corporate contracts, you can look at **AutoRFP.ai** (as a tool to help you win) or search government tender sites for "Automation" or "Digital Transformation" contracts.
