Your elynt AI startup is well-positioned because you’re targeting mid-segment, non-tech companies. The mistake most AI founders make is marketing AI. Your customers don’t buy AI — they buy solved problems.

Below is a clear, executable customer-acquisition playbook 👇

⸻

1️⃣ Stop Selling “AI”. Sell One Pain

Why this matters:
Non-tech customers don’t wake up thinking “I need AI”. They wake up thinking:
	•	“My approvals are slow”
	•	“My team wastes time”
	•	“My data is scattered”
	•	“Decisions take too long”

Pick ONE core pain to start

Examples (you should choose one):
	•	Approval workflows taking days
	•	Manual report creation
	•	Customer queries handled slowly
	•	Sales follow-ups missed
	•	Internal data not searchable

Your message should be:

“We reduce your approval time from 7 days to 1 day.”

Not:

“We build agentic AI solutions.”

⸻

2️⃣ Define Your Exact First Customer

Be narrow. Very narrow.

Example ICP:
	•	Company size: 30–200 employees
	•	Industry: Logistics / Manufacturing / Healthcare admin / Real estate
	•	Decision maker: Founder / Ops Head / Admin Head
	•	Tech maturity: Low to medium

📌 If you try to sell to “everyone”, you’ll sell to no one.

⸻

3️⃣ Founder-Led Outreach (This Is Non-Negotiable)

Early customers won’t come from ads. They come from you.

A. LinkedIn (your strongest weapon)

You already write on LinkedIn — use this structure:

Daily (Mon–Fri):
	•	1 short post = one real business pain
	•	No AI jargon
	•	No sales pitch

Example:

“Yesterday I spoke to a company where 5 approvals were needed just to buy a ₹5,000 item.
That delay costs more than the item itself.”

👉 This attracts the right people.

Then:
	•	Comment meaningfully on posts by founders & ops heads
	•	Send contextual DMs (not pitch)

DM format:

“Saw your post on operational delays.
I’m working with similar teams to cut approval time drastically.
Would love to understand how you handle it.”

No links. No decks. Just conversation.

⸻

B. Warm Network (Fastest wins)

Make a list of:
	•	Ex-colleagues
	•	Friends in business
	•	Friends’ parents running businesses
	•	Toastmasters contacts
	•	LinkedIn mutuals

Send this:

“I’ve started elynt AI to solve one specific ops problem for growing companies.
Can I understand how you currently handle it? No selling.”

You’ll be surprised how many say yes.

⸻

4️⃣ Offer a Pilot, Not a Product

Non-tech companies fear:
	•	Cost
	•	Risk
	•	Complexity

So don’t sell a product yet.

Sell this instead:
	•	30-day pilot
	•	One workflow
	•	Fixed low price (or free for first 2–3 clients)

Example:

“In 30 days, we automate one approval process.
If it doesn’t help, you don’t continue.”

📌 First 5 customers are for learning + proof, not revenue.

⸻

5️⃣ Turn Each Pilot into a Story

After pilot success, immediately capture:
	•	Before vs After
	•	Time saved
	•	Errors reduced
	•	Human quotes

Example:

“Earlier approvals took 6 days. Now it’s done in 1 day.”

Use this as:
	•	LinkedIn posts
	•	Website case study
	•	DM credibility

Social proof > features.

⸻

6️⃣ Offline Works Surprisingly Well (in India)

Don’t ignore this.

Where to go:
	•	Local business meetups
	•	Industry associations
	•	CA offices (they know many SMEs)
	•	Co-working spaces
	•	Chamber of Commerce events

Your one-liner:

“We help growing companies remove internal delays without hiring more people.”

That opens conversations.

⸻

7️⃣ Pricing Mindset (Very Important)

For mid-segment, non-tech firms:
	•	Avoid per-token, per-API talk
	•	Avoid complex SaaS pricing

Instead:
	•	Monthly retainer
	•	Or per-workflow pricing

They want predictability, not sophistication.

⸻

8️⃣ What NOT to Do (Early Stage)

❌ Ads
❌ Fancy website
❌ Cold email blasts
❌ Over-engineering
❌ Talking about LLMs, RAG, agents

You already have deep tech strength — now you must hide it behind simplicity.

⸻

9️⃣ Your Personal Edge (Use This)

You have:
	•	11+ years engineering credibility
	•	Telecom + large systems background
	•	Clear thinking
	•	Strong communication (Toastmasters)

So position yourself as:

“A tech leader who understands business chaos.”

Not just “AI founder”.

⸻
