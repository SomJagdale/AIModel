Since your interview is starting soon (it’s currently Saturday morning, Jan 3rd), here is a "Cheat Sheet" for a first-time founder interviewing an intern.

### 1. The Opening (First 5 Minutes)

Your goal is to break the ice. If the candidate is nervous, you won't see their true potential.

* **The Vibe:** Be warm and energetic. Since **Elynt.ai** is a startup, you want to show that it’s a fun, fast-paced place to work.
* **The Smile:** **Smile.** A neutral "stone face" can be intimidating and might make the candidate shut down. A smile signals that you are a partner, not a judge.
* **Intro:** "Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name], founder of Elynt.ai. We're building specialized AI agents to [your vision]. Thanks for joining us on a Saturday!"
* **Set the Agenda:** "I’d love to hear about your background, walk through a few technical/logic questions, and then I'll leave time for you to ask me anything."

### 2. Transitioning Between Questions

Avoid "interrogation style" where you just fire questions. Use **Bridges**.

* **The Bridge Technique:** Acknowledge their previous answer before moving on.
* **Example:** *"That’s a great explanation of how you handled that Python project. Building on that technical interest, how do you think AI agents will change that specific workflow in the future?"*
* **Moving to a new topic:** *"Switching gears a bit, I'd like to talk about how you work in a team..."*

### 3. Responding to Answers (Correct vs. Incorrect)

* **If the answer is correct:** Don't just say "Okay." Give a small "Gold Star" by saying, *"Exactly,"* or *"I like how you thought about the edge cases there."*
* **If the answer is incorrect:** Do **not** say "That's wrong." Instead, guide them.
* *Say:* "That’s one way to look at it. But in a production environment where [Factor X] is a problem, how would you adjust that logic?"
* *Why:* You want to see if they can **coach** and take feedback. In a startup, being "coachable" is more important for an intern than being 100% right immediately.



### 4. Motivating the Candidate

You are also "selling" your startup. Interns often choose startups based on the founder's energy.

* **Share the Vision:** "We are in the early days of the Agentic AI revolution. The work you do here as an intern won't be just coffee runs; you'll be building parts of the core engine."
* **Encourage curiosity:** If they seem stuck, say, *"There's no single right answer here, I'm just interested in your thought process."*

### 5. The Closing (Last 5 Minutes)

* **Ask them:** "What is one thing about Elynt.ai that you're curious about?"
* **Next Steps:** Be clear. "We are talking to a few more people this weekend. You can expect to hear from us by [Tuesday]."
* **Thank them:** "I really enjoyed our chat. Have a great rest of your Saturday."

### 6. Post-Interview Rating (The "Scorecard")

Don't rely on "gut feeling." Rate them on a scale of 1–5 on these three pillars:

| Category | What to look for |
| --- | --- |
| **Technical Aptitude** | Can they explain LLMs/Agents simply? Can they code/solve logic? |
| **Startup "Grit"** | Are they okay with ambiguity? Do they show initiative? |
| **Communication** | Can they explain complex ideas without rambling? |

> **Pro Tip:** If the answer to *"Would I want to work with this person for 10 hours a day in a high-stress week?"* is a "No," then don't hire them, even if they are a genius.
