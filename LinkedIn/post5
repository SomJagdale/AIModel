The realization that General AI wasn't enough

We have spent the last few months quietly building, fueled by a specific frustration.

We all love tools like ChatGPT. They are incredible generalists. They are the "Jack of all trades."

But when I tried to use them for code review, they fell short. They lacked context. They hallucinated. They felt like a junior intern guessing the answers.

I realized the future isn't just more AI. It’s Specialized AI.

We are building something new. An agent that doesn’t just "chat," but actually understands the nuance of your requirements and pain points.

The core difference?

It’s not designed to write poems or plan travel. It is designed to do a one specific high-value task better than any human or general bot could.

We aren't quite ready to show the world yet, but the early tests are giving me goosebumps.

Back to the code.
