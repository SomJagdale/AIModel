We realized something big about AI recently. 

Using a general AI chatbot for real work is like trying to build a house with a Swiss Army Knife. Sure, it has a tiny saw blade. You can cut wood with it if you try hard enough. 
But wouldn't you rather use a real power saw? 

These big AI models know a little bit about everything. But they don't know the deep, important details of your specific job. And when they don't know the answer? They guess. That is scary for a business. 

That is why we changed our focus at Elynt. We stopped trying to make the big, general AI smarter. 

Instead, we started building specialized agents. We don't need a trivia expert. We need a worker who actually knows the trade. The future isn't one big AI doing everything. It is many expert agents working together. 

That is the bet we are making.
